      By day, I am an informatics engineer with ~8 years of experience helping biotech companies digitalize and automate their research and development laboratories. My goal is to enable scientists to innovate more efficiently, and to achieve that I focus on improving user experiences with LIMS, ELN, and related data management systems.
