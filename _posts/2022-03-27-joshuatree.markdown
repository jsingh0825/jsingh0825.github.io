I camped out on a dried lake bed north of Joshua Tree (the town), and saw yet another incredible sunset (is this a desert thing?) before spending a day exploring Joshua Tree National Park.

## Black Canyon and Panorama Loop Trails

On the west side of the park, there’s a network of trails that goes from sandy scrubland to rocky overlooks where you can see the San Jacinto mountain range. The Joshua trees were beginning to bloom!

## More trees, more rocks

Driving through the east side of the park, there’s tons of rocky formations and tree-lined fields to explore.
