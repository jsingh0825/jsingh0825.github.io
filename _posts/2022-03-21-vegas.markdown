The plan was to head to Utah after Arizona - it was still well quite cold in Bryce and Zion so I went to Nevada instead.

## The Hoover Dam and Lake Mead

I stopped by the Hoover Dam. It’s huge! An incredible feat of engineering*. That evening I drove into the hills, camping on Lake Mead nearby and enjoying a sunset over the Las Vegas Bay.

## Red Rock Canyon

West of Vegas, Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area has tons of great hiking and sightseeing. I hiked the Calico Tanks trail up to a nice view of the Las Vegas Valley.

## Icy Waterfalls in the Spring Mountains

On the other side of Red Rock Canyon, the Spring Mountains experience a fairly different climate this time of year. I hiked to Mary Jane Falls (hehe), and there was still snow on the ground. The falls were sparse, but formed really cool ice mounds at the bottom!

\*As much of a technical achievement as it is, it’s important to note the Hoover Dam’s effect on Indigenous people’s lives – not only is it built on Indigenous lands, it has also had significant negative downstream effects.
