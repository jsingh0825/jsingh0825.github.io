After Joshua Tree, I spent some time in San Diego and LA visiting friends and attending a wedding! From there I went on to Sequoia National Park.

## Driving into the Sierras

The drive up into the Sierra Mountains took me through beautiful lakes and winding hills.

## Big ole trees

Visiting Sequoia National Park was ultimately bittersweet. I had never seen trees this large in my life! They were breathtaking, but there was also quite a bit of fire damage to large sections of the park. Thankfully redwood trees are somewhat fire resistant (read more <a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/shirley/sec6.htm" target="_blank">here</a>).

## Cows!

On my way out of Sequoia and across central CA, I drove through a ton of hilly farmlands. Please see attached for cows.
