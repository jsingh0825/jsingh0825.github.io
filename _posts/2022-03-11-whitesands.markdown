After Big Bend, I left Texas for New Mexico to check out White Sands, and then made my way over to Arizona.

## Boquillas Canyon hike

The flowering trees were audibly buzzing with bees! Also halfway down the trail there was a guy on a horse selling tamales

## Crossing the border to Mexico

I rode a burro into town and had cabrito tacos. After I ate them the owner of the restaurant told me cabrito is like the goat version of veal and I felt bad.
