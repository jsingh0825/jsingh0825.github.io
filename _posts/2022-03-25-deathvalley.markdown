After heading west from Nevada into California, I spent a couple days exploring Death Valley.

## Zabriskie Point and Sunset

Zabriskie Point overlooks eroded sedimentary formations on the west side of the park. From there I drove to a dispersed campsite off of the main road for the evening and enjoyed a truly bananas sunset. I’d never seen clouds this red!!

## Sunrise on the Sand Dunes

The next morning, I drove over to the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes and hiked in to catch the sun rising over them. Hiking in sand sucks. The view did not!

## Mosaic Canyon Trail

I spent the rest of the morning hiking the Mosaic Canyon trail. Cool rocks! I appreciated that someone arranged rocks into arrows on the ground to help keep folks on the path.

## Badwater Basin

That afternoon, I went to Badwater Basin which is the lowest point in the United States! Unbelievably hot, even in springtime
