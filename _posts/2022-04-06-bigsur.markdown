From Sequoia National Park, I drove across CA to San Simeon and up Highway 1 along the coast to Big Sur.

## Elephant Seals!

Just north of San Simeon, a small shoreline is populated by elephant seals. From the observation deck (and with a handy zoom lens) I caught them lazing about and occasionally butting heads! Extremely cute.

## Driving up Highway 1

This was one of my most anticipated stretches of the road trip, Iâ€™d always wanted to drive up the California coast. I drove north about 70 miles and stopped at almost every scenic point! The winding roads were a blast to drive on and the views of the cliffs overlooking the ocean were incredible.

## Hiking in Big Sur

I set out on a trail system in Andrew Molera State Park (AllTrails <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/creamery-meadow-bluffs-panorama-and-ridge-trail-loop">link</a>), starting with a climb up Pfeiffer Ridge.

After a small forested area atop the ridge, the trail turns down into bluffs along the shoreline. This section was lush with wildflowers and other foliage.

About halfway down the bluffs, there is a detour to a small beach!
