From Tucson, I drove over to Phoenix. Met up with friends and one suggested I hike the Camelback Mountain Trail, so

## I Hiked the Camelback Mountain Trail

Very challenging! Excellent workout and great views of the city as the sun rose.

## The Grand Canyon

My family flew in and we drove up to the Grand Canyon together (: we spent a day exploring the South Rim. I’m not good enough at writing to put into words how it felt seeing it

*A group of elk crossed our path on the way into the park!*

## Driving North and Leaving Arizona

After a few more days in Phoenix, I drove back up through Sedona and Flagstaff on my way out of Arizona. Fun drive, varied scenery, all around a good time.
